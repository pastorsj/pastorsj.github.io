### Web Development IDE's
#### Powerful vs Fast?
##### By Sam Pastoriza on August 9, 2016

Does a fast and responsive IDE neccesarily mean it is not powerful?

Can you make it powerful with addons like code completion syntax highlighting?

These are a few of the questions being asked by young developers when they are choosing the perfect
ide for their next project. In my case, my focus is on full stack development, where I care about everything
from stored procedures in SQL databases to optimizing SASS code on the front end. Everything from those two 
extremes must be encompassed in my perfect IDE. 

Many developers want a fast, responsive, and powerful IDE for development. Their is no perfect environment for 
developers because the possibilites out there are endless. The three standard options for a web developer like 
myself are

1. [Jetbrain's WebStorms]
2. [Vim]
3. [Microsoft's Visual Code]

These range from full blown separate applications to terminal editors. Lets discuss all three options.

### WebStorms
Webstorms is a pure JavaScript IDE made by Jetbrains. When you download it, which by the way, it is not free, but I have
a student license, it has out of the box support for syntav highlighting and code completion for node and angular 1 and 2. 
Similar to the rest of the Jetbrains products, including Intellij IDEA, it has support for refactoring code and has a built in terminal. 
It does not end there. 

List all the important features that Webstorms contains.

The fact that you can use only Webstorms and develop almost any Javascript based program ever is extremely impressive. For me, 
the framework support is the most important. This summer, I am working as an intern at Ciena, and there they are using EmberJS, which 
is a open source MVC Javascript framework. I can never remember every method associated with Ember store object or what options are availible 
when I am writing a serializer, but Webstorms provides that support. I can simply install the Ember plugin for Webstorms and off I go. 
Webstorms is definitely the way to go if your looking for an all in one solution. 

The few problems that I find with Webstorms is

1. The amount of CPU usage is off the charts. Since Webstorms is an all in one solution, it takes up much of the CPU and many computers just 
can't handle it running full steam.
2. I don't think I will ever manage to utilize all of Webstorms capabilities. There is so much packed into the IDE that many features that I 
could use to speed up development I won't every know exist.

Overall, this is a solid IDE that any programmer could use and enjoy. So why would someone not want to use this IDE? For most of the all in one
solutions, there is a lot of movement using the mouse, which wastes valuable time in some peoples mind. Many programmers would ultimately prefer
to keep their hands on the keyboard and use keyboard shortcuts to navigate the code. Enter Vim...

### Vim
Vim is the ultimate command line editor. Others include *nano*, *less*, and *emacs*. Vim is powered by the open source community with its thousands of
possible plugins for code schemes and code completion tools. The main feature of Vim is its keyboard shortcuts. The learning curve of Vim is ridiculous, 
sometimes taking years to master it. But once a master of Vim, always a master of Vim. Masters of Vim can write code faster than anyone skilled with
a mouse and Webstorms. You can setup a Vim IDE with a strong set of plugins and go to work in no time. It is universal to operating systems and almost 
neccesary for server side programming.

I have personally used Vim and for a week, I programmed only using Vim. I did not get much done, so in my spare time, I had to constantly remind myself 
of all the shortcuts and features that Vim has to offer. I do have a .vimrc on my GitHub that contains what I thought was the neccesary tools for 
developing using Vim.

Advantages of Vim

1. Once you have mastered Vim, you can essentially program anything from anywhere at the fastest speed. If you need to update some code on a server, you can 
be working on it in seconds. Webstorms does not allow the user to open up any code on a server.
2. Plugins are easy to add once you have the right plugin loader installed (I use Vundle). It is as easy as adding a line of code to your .vimrc
3. Similarly to the plugins idea, the editor is full cusotmizable, and you can easily create your own plugins using the Viml language.
4. It is very lightweight on the CPU.

Disadvantages of Vim

1. The learning curve is ridiculous. That is all.

Vim is for the adventurous who have time and and good typists. I didn't have much time, but it is a skill I am still attempting to learn.

So there must be a middle ground, an IDE which is lightweight, has good plugin support, and is powerful. I find that in Visual Code. Many others find
this middle ground in Sublime Text and Atom. Visual Code just appeals to me more, but the advantages and disadvantages apply to both.
